## Objective
Conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests.

## User Story
As someone interested in improving my health and leading a healthier lifestyle, I want to be able to obtain my Body Mass Index (BMI) based on my age, weight and height; and benchmark it against standard BMIâ€™s of people with similar demographics.
Based on the benchmarking result, I want to receive nutritional and exercise routine recommendations.
I also want to be able to store my initial BMI as a baseline and track my progress based on predetermined intervals.

## User Workflow
When I enter the application;
then I am prompted to enter name, age, gender, weight, height and food preferences.
When I enter this prompted information;
then I am provided with my Body Mass Index (BMI) and I am immediately benchmarked against people with similar demographics and given the option to receive recommendations on nutrition and exercise routine.
When I select the nutrition button;
I am provided with a menu recommendation based on the objective I want to achieve.
When I select the exercise routine button;
I am provided with an exercise routine based on the objective I want to achieve.
